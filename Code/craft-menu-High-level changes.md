— High-level changes (what & why)

Replace ad-hoc batching with rAF batching — when writing DOM after reading it, batch writes inside requestAnimationFrame to avoid layout thrash.

Use MutationObserver (single short-lived observer) to detect CMS-inserted nodes rather than repeated queries / ad-hoc waiting.

Cache DOM references & results in Map/WeakMap and avoid calling querySelectorAll in hot paths (e.g., on every category click).

Event delegation for rows/subcategory clicks when possible — attach one listener to the container instead of many listeners.

Use CSS classes and CSS variables to change visual state instead of inline style.* as much as possible — this generates fewer style recalculations and keeps CSS central.

Use DocumentFragment or createElement loops for constructing per-character headings instead of building large innerHTML strings, which is safer and faster.

Cache immutable computations (e.g., prefers-reduced-motion result, slug regex) to avoid recomputation.

Single-retry / graceful fallback: if a dynamic resource (e.g., CMS logos) doesn't appear in X ms, do one careful retry and then warn — don’t continuously poll.

Use IntersectionObserver for logos or example animations for lazy reveal and to avoid animating offscreen content.

Keep backwards compatibility: maintain dataset attributes, resetCrafty() public API, and the overall selection logic.

2 — Concrete, safe replacements (copy / paste into file)

Below are replacement implementations for the most impactful functions. They are drop-in compatible: they preserve existing inputs/outputs and add caching and batching.

Where I say "replace function X", replace that function's body in your file. If your file uses different function names, adapt accordingly.

A — Replace batchDOMUpdates(callback)

Why: the current function executes immediately. For grouped DOM writes, run them inside requestAnimationFrame so they happen together.
